          Plug-in filter based on the SNAKE technique that allows the tracing of
          images, identifying areas accurately.

          <b>Abstract</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The elaboration and execution of the present filter coded in Java
          language was carried out through the use of Java language and was
          achieved through the use of ImageJ and NetBeans software, thus
          allowing to verify that the method used presents satisfactory results
          in the segmentation of images due to its better results in endoscopy
          images than in ultrasound images.
